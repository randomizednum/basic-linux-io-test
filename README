A program utilizing primitive methods of input and output in the Linux kernel. mousedev (provides a PS/2 mouse-compatible device), fbdev (provides primitive displaying options) and ALSA (the sound subsytem) are currently used.

Compile with

	cc *.c -lm

Note that this is a demonstration (intended to provide an example of how one can interact with the Linux kernel directly for I/O), not a collection of utilities or libraries. For example, the framebuffer handling is naive and inefficient, there is a trivial way mouse handling can enter an infinite loop, and the part utilizing ALSA is a complete mess in general.

TODO list:
* A way to receive inputs from keyboard (stdin doesn't suffice)
* Better understanding of ALSA
